* [Bismuth Core Developer Interview](https://peakd.com/@aetsen/bismuth-developer-interview-hclivess) (March 07, 2018)  
  Bismuth adds external indexing for open-field data, which boosts performance incredibly for tasks like token handling and aliases. The feature came from tokens and found its place in the open-field operations related to node globally, which is nice.

## Bismuth In the press

* [Bismuth - No ICO, No Premine and First Python Coin!](https://steemit.com/bitcoin/@kingscrown/bismuth-no-ico-no-premine-and-first-python-coin) (May 10, 2017)  
  Bismuth has decentralized applications creation option and there are already dAPPS to use - [Backup](https://peakd.com/bitcoin/@kingscrown/bismuth-no-ico-no-premine-and-first-python-coin)  

* [Solution to the codebase consensus conflict in context of the Bismuth Blockchain](https://medium.com/@uploadbeforeyoudie/semantic-interpretation-solution-to-the-codebase-consensus-conflict-in-context-of-the-bismuth-35dbfafc82a7) (July, 19 2018)  
  The semantic interpretation approach to the singular codebase problem. In this model, the core system remains untouched and is governed by consensus. The semantic interpretation level exists above the core layer. 

* [Bismuth Hypernodes on masternodes.com](http://www.masternodes.com/news/hypernodes-a-bismuths-feature/) (August 3, 2018)  
  The main-net consensus mechanism is sha-224 Proof-of-Work based and the hypernode side-chain has Proof-of-Stake properties.

* [Coin Report - Bismuth](https://www.altcointradershandbook.com/coin-report-bismuth/) (December 7, 2018)  
  Bismuth is innovative at its core in that it is the first blockchain written in Python, and thus the team must know their coin inside out and be committed enough to the project to write any additional features for it from scratch.
